# Simple Accordion Component

A basic accordion built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Click on headings to toggle content visibility
- Only one section open at a time
- Smooth and clean UI with basic styling

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on any accordion heading to expand/collapse its content.

## How It Works

- JavaScript listens for clicks on headings.
- Shows the corresponding content while hiding others.
- Uses CSS `.active` class to toggle visibility.

## Future Improvements

- Add slide animations
- Support multiple open sections
- Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles)
